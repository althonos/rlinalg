## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

[The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) provides
an environment for using and developing statistical methods. Most of the array
manipulation and linear algebra routines are implemented using 
[LAPACK]. In Python, the [NumPy] library can be used for array manipulation, 
while [SciPy] offers access to [LAPACK]. 

However, when trying to port and reproduce code from R in Python, one can 
notice differences in the implementation of several rountines, in particular
in the [$QR$ decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) 
with pivoting enabled:

```r
> mat <- t(matrix(seq_len(9), nrow=3))
> qr.Q(mat)
           [,1]       [,2]       [,3]
[1,] -0.1230915  0.9045340  0.4082483
[2,] -0.4923660  0.3015113 -0.8164966
[3,] -0.8616404 -0.3015113  0.4082483
```

```python
>>> mat = numpy.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
>>> scipy.linalg.qr(mat, pivoting = True)[0]
array([[-0.2672612  0.8728716  0.4082483]
       [-0.5345225  0.2182179 -0.8164966]
       [-0.8017837 -0.4364358  0.4082483]])
```

The culprit here is the [`qr`] function from R not using [LAPACK] [`dgeqp3`] 
by default, but a R-specific modified version of the [LINPACK] [`dqrdc`] 
routine (`dqrdc2`) that optimizes the pivoting strategy. This means that code 
using [`qr`] in R will behave differently than an equivalent Python using 
[LAPACK], and there is (so far) no way to reproduce the R behaviour.

The `rlinalg` library provides linear algebra routines from R using the 
Fortran sources to allow reproducibility. It exposes an API similar to 
the `scipy` interface for similar functions (`qr`, `cond`), which can be used
to get the same results as R:


```python
>>> mat = numpy.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
>>> rlinalg.qr(mat, pivoting = True)[0].round(7)
array([[-0.1230915  0.904534   0.4082483]
       [-0.492366   0.3015113 -0.8164966]
       [-0.8616404 -0.3015113  0.4082483]])
```

This library only depends on NumPy and is available for all modern Python 
versions (3.6+).
